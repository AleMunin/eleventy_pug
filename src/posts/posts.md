# This is a page for the collection.

Note that the content remains while the pagination will change bellow.

## Content Removal

If you don't want its content (written in 'posts.pug'), just remove the content block. The file it extends will not crash.

## Types of Usage

This kind of page is useful to make paginations, summaries, and anything related to properly hosting the other pages within a collection.

All you need to do is give the same name for the markdown file as the collection.

You might also want to preferably use another layout on the template, so you can loop through this collection or overall set them apart.

This page WILL show up o the collection loops if not made some kind of exception.
