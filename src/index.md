# Welcome to Eleventy Pug

The goal of this project is to make a very common, [self-explanatory pug-eleventy example](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself).

While you can absolutely learn pug template in a couple hours, implementing it on eleventy is hard work due to a lack in documentation.

This template hopes to accomplish a base set up and lead by simple examples, not leading through a rabbithole of breadcrumbs trying to figure out code, not trying to be fancy.

You can either learn from dissecting this template or simply clone it, delete any content, and get busy without thinking of the boring set up.

What you see is what you get, explanations are either their own pages or are commented within the code.

This is the end of index.md
