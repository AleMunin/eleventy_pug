# Welcome to Eleventy Pug

The goal of this project is to make a very common, [self-explanatory pug-eleventy example](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself).

This template hopes to accomplish simple structural examples, with simple documented language. Not trying to be fancy, not trying anything spectacular. You can either learn how to use it by reading its content, or just delete the pages and use the mixins and blocks for your own projects, as a boilerplate of sorts.

# We need documentation in Eleventy (pugmentation?)

While you can absolutely learn pug template and eleventy in a couple hours, implementing them together is challenging if you're not very familiar with both, due to lack in documentation. In theory, you should just convert .njk examples to a .pug syntax, but my experience has been a crossover of jenga with minefield.

I never knew what I was doing wrong, and it was very time consuming to find an example and compare what was working, what didn't make sense, and what was just me learning wrong as I had to assume a lot of ideas while forgetting the basics de to the lack of light on the end of the rabbit hole.

This all could be avoided if more resources were readily available like more popular templates. Which is a shame, because as much of a headache it has been for a rookie like me, I cannot stress enough how Pug and Eleventy are worth learning.

If you happen to have resources on the matter, let me know, I'll add the links in this project so newcomers (or future, forgetful me) can learn from them!
