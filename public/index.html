<p>The goal of this project is to make a very common, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">self-explanatory pug-eleventy example</a>.</p>
<p>While you can absolutely learn pug template in a couple hours, implementing it on eleventy is hard work due to a lack in documentation.</p>
<p>This template hopes to accomplish a base set up and lead by simple examples, not leading through a rabbithole of breadcrumbs trying to figure out code, not trying to be fancy.</p>
<p>You can either learn from dissecting this template or simply clone it, delete any content, and get busy without thinking of the boring set up.</p>
<p>What you see is what you get, explanations are either their own pages or are commented within the code.</p>
<p>This is the end of index.md</p>
