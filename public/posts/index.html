<p>Note that the content remains while the pagination will change bellow.</p>
<h2>Content Removal</h2>
<p>If you don't want its content (written in 'posts.pug'), just remove the content block. The file it extends will not crash.</p>
<h2>Types of Usage</h2>
<p>This kind of page is useful to make paginations, summaries, and anything related to properly hosting the other pages within a collection.</p>
<p>All you need to do is give the same name for the markdown file as the collection.</p>
<hr>
<p>You might also want to preferably use another layout on the template, so you can loop through this collection or overall set them apart.</p>
<hr>
<p>This page WILL show up o the collection loops if not made some kind of exception.</p>
