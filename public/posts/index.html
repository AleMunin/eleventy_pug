<h1>This is a page for the collection.</h1>
<p>It is useful to make paginations, summaries, and anything related to properly hosting the other pages within a collection.</p>
<p>All you need to do is give the same name for the markdown file as the collection.</p>
<hr>
<p>You might also want to preferably use another layout on the template, so you can loop through this collection or overall set them apart.</p>
<hr>
<p>This page WILL show up o the collection loops if not made some kind of exception.</p>
