<p>You can't just reference an image file in eleventy.</p>
<p>That is why we have the passthrough function for the assets folder.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/example1.png" alt="this-is-an-img-alt"></p>
<p><a href="../../assets/img/example1.png">Do not forget the ! before the format, otherwise this will become a link</a></p>
<p>This image has been referenced on markdown, you can make a shorter path within the images, so they share the same folder. If you do so, check if you don't need to put the path on a watch target function on eleventy.js</p>
