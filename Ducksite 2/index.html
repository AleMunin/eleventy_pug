<!-- Archieved notes for your own amuzement:

1. Why is Bulma by default making a botton pading on <body>?????????!!!!????

    even 100vh is not solving it

    Seriously, you have no idea how frustrating it is. It is like that since i just put the cdn, there was nothing else interfeering

    (╬ Ò ‸ Ó)


2. You'd think that at some point i'd learn to stop fighting for precedence on my own css, since it is the one thing
    i never forgot about css, but here we are.

3. I somehow managed to make an id for an object, address a specific css to that id, and sass does not think it is on
    the page, so it never generates the css for it

    I have no idea how bulma is overriding an id, so i'm fighting fire with fire and hardcoding 
    the bulma classes to save time and it is working    ¯\_((╥﹏╥)_/¯

4. And now even a very dumb div class="join-us column is-9 has-text-centered section is-multiline" is not
    having their background color affected even if i put !important. THERE IS NOTHING AFFECTING IT
    No code saying it should have another background or any inheritance rule.

5. There is a reason why I don't do this for a living.

6. Apparently, the reason why css is not being generated properly is because VScode's live server is watching sass and...
    making some kind of cache? Instead of re-writing everything or detecting actual changes, not all gets generated.

    I separated the set up variables and bulma files from the main css, and it still kept thinking there was a variable not declared.

    Then i noticed it was NOT making a map or adding code to this new file that sets things up... at all. It was like it was cached information.

    then i went to the most common variable... changed its properties... nothing changed.

    then i commented its declaration out and... nothing changed. Wth is going on.

7. I had to delete my local files to finally get one of the messages that would be relevant to the cascade of other error messages that had cold trails:
"Error: Nothing may be indented beneath a variable declaration."

    I swear this wasn't on the first pile of errors until i did that.

    I am now back to a variable declaration problem, even though said variable is literally the 4th line of sass to run.

    Apparently it is an importing problem.

    * purposely writes a bad import *

    Compiler: That is an import problem!

    * writes import/use as instructed on official documentation *

    Combiler stops bitching about import problem but doesn't use my variables from the partials.

8. I give up. I'm adding all the variables to one single sass file. It solved the problem instantly.
